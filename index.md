# Quadcopter Project
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make her/him want to read more.

Ex.: For our project, my partner and I programmed a quadcopter to fly stably and accurately follow a path indicated by a series of colored balls. We did this by deriving the equations of motion for the quadcopter, tuning its parameters in MATLAB, testing and tweaking the parameters by flying the quadcopter, and creating a path for the quadcopter to follow.

# Final Milestone
Our final milestone was programming a path for the quadcopter to follow based on several colored balls, including a moving ball. My partner had to be careful about what color clothes she wore during testing or else the quadcopter would try to hover by her instead of over the ball! Getting the Kinect to recognize multiple similarly colored balls was also a challenge.

# Third Milestone
Our third milestone was tuning the parameters that we had found through simulation in MATLAB by flying the quadcopter. We first tested the commands our code gave to the quadcopter without providing any thrust so that we could see if the roll, pitch, and yaw values were reasonable. Once we adjusted our parameters such that those values were reasonable, we applied thrust to the quadcopter and tested how accurately the quadcopter could follow some basic paths. After adjusting a parameter to have the quadcopter follow the path more accurately, it flew directly at the Kinect! Significantly decreasing that parameter later removed that effect and improved the quadcopter's accuracy.

# Second Milestone
Our second milestone was finding the initial flight parameters that best fit a set of given criteria for optimal flight behavior. We thoroughly tested and recorded the simulated behavior for each parameter and selected the values that adhered most to the desired behavior. This was very time-consuming, but it made for pretty effective parameters overall!

# First Milestone
Our first milestone was deriving the equations of motions needed to control the quadcopter! This determined the equations we would need to code into MATLAB so that we could find the correct control parameters and so the quadcopter could fly stably.
